A sane, fully documented Python deployment model
================================================

During my tenure as CTO of `LaterPay <https://laterpay.net/>`_ we (that mostly being @jdelic (me), @arenstar and 
@doismellburning) experimented a lot with deploying Python in different ways. Now that I am a free agent, I first 
started reimplementing what we had at LaterPay for my own use, but subsequently realized that it might be useful 
for other people. So, have a fully documented sane deployment model for Python. For free. :)
